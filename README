Sample Wakanda SSJS Library to integrate with Freshbooks

A test script is provided to demonstrate how to use the 
Clients Freshbook API and perform basic CRUD operations.
It does not address any other APIs nor List operations.

Feel free to utilize the code in any way you want.

I will not be doing any more work on the library.
